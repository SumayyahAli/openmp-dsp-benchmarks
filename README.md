# Digital Signal Processing & Image Processing | (Serial C vs OpenMP) Benchmarks

This project evaluates the performance of common Digital Signal Processing and Image Processing algorithms implemented in C and parallelized using OpenMP.
No advanced OpenMP optimization was applied; the focus is to see how adding minimal OpenMP directives to serial C code affects runtime behavior across different data sizes.
The results highlight the trade-off between compute intensity and parallel overhead on multicore CPUs.

## Environment and Methodology

- **Hardware:** IntelÂ® i9 CPU (14 cores, 20 processors )  
- **Compiler:** GCC with `-O3 -fopenmp`
- **Timing:** `omp_get_wtime()` averaged over 3 runs  
- **Threads:** Default OpenMP configuration (`omp_get_max_threads()` = all logical processors).
- **MATLAB usage:** Generating signals, designing FIR coefficients, and plotting results
